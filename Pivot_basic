-- Creating a basic pivot in SQL

-- Step 1 : write query for the info needed
  select customer_id, amount, left(datename(month, txn_date),3) as txn_month
 from dbo.al_dl_customer
 where txn_date in ('2019-08-31','2019-07-31')
 
  -- step 2: write the pivot part
 sum(amount) for txn_month in ('Jul','Aug') as pvt --WRONG-- don't put months' names in '' - will give error
 -- so : No 'Jul' , but  simply Jul
 pivot (sum(amount) for txn_month in (Jul,Aug)) as pvt
 
 -- step 3: append the two
 -- select * from (part 1) 
 --pivot (part 2)
 
 select * from (select customer_id, amount, left(datename(month, txn_date),3) as txn_month
 from dbo.al_dl_customer
 where txn_date in ('2019-08-31','2019-07-31'))ss
 pivot (sum(amount) for txn_month in (Jul,Aug)) as pvt
  
-----Generic pivot
select customer_id, M3,M2,M1 FROM 
( SELECT customer_id, amt, bal_date,
lead(amt,2) over (partition by customer_id order by bal_date desc) as M3,
lead(amt,1) over (partition by customer_id order by bal_date desc) as M2,
lead(amt,0) over (partition by customer_id order by bal_date desc) as M1
from
(select customer_id, amt, bal_date from tbl_prev_months
where bal_date >= cast(dateadd(month,-2,(dateadd(day,-day(getdate())),getdate()))) as date)
union all
select customer_id, amt, bal_date from tbl_thismonth)tt
where bal_date = (select max(bal_date) from tbl_thismonth)


-- generic pivot
select * from 
(select category, case when datediff(day,creation_date,getdate()) <= 30 then 'one_month'
when datediff(day,creation_date,getdate())>30 and datediff(day,creation_date,getdate()) <= 60 then 'two_months' end as timeline
from tbl_name
where datediff(day,creation_date,getdate()) <= 60
and category in ('A','B')) ss
pivot (count(timeline) for timeline in (one_month,two_months)) as pvt

--- output of above
category	one_month	two_months
A       	2102	    2011
B       	22231	    23241
