-- Creating a basic pivot in SQL

-- Step 1 : write query for the info needed
  select customer_id, amount, left(datename(month, txn_date),3) as txn_month
 from dbo.al_dl_customer
 where txn_date in ('2019-08-31','2019-07-31')
 
  -- step 2: write the pivot part
 sum(amount) for txn_month in ('Jul','Aug') as pvt --WRONG-- don't put months' names in '' - will give error
 -- so : No 'Jul' , but  simply Jul
 pivot (sum(amount) for txn_month in (Jul,Aug)) as pvt
 
 -- step 3: append the two
 -- select * from (part 1) 
 --pivot (part 2)
 
 select * from (select customer_id, amount, left(datename(month, txn_date),3) as txn_month
 from dbo.al_dl_customer
 where txn_date in ('2019-08-31','2019-07-31'))ss
 pivot (sum(amount) for txn_month in (Jul,Aug)) as pvt
